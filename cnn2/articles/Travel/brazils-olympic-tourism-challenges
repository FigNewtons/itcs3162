 (CNN)The Rio Olympic Games 2016  are just four months away, only half the tickets are sold and headlines continue to focus on Brazil's political protests, recession and battle with the Zika virus. 
But with the venue's construction on schedule and hotels almost completely booked for the event, organizers are optimistic they'll be able to fill the stands.
Mario Andrada, spokesman for Rio 2016, said they want the games to be the turn-around moment and bring good energy. 
"We have been working for almost 10 years for this moment to happen," he told CNN.
"We're very confident in the Olympic tickets that we're going to sell."  
He added that Brazilians are always late buyers.

As for international tourists, organizers still expect half a million visitors to descend on Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Olympic Games, which take place from August 5-21. 
Officials with the Brazilian Hotel Association say there haven't been any cancellations in spite of all the bad publicity. 
In fact, thanks to the cheaper currency, it says Rio's hotels are almost 100% booked already.
