The Clemson Tigers came up just short in their chase for a national championship in 2015, but the same excitement and level of expectation awaits the 2016 football team. We will get our first look at that team in Saturday's spring game. 
The spring game will give us an opportunity to see a lot of young players try to prove themselves and also a first look at the freshmen who enrolled early. The game can be seen on ESPN3 at 2:30 p.m. ET, but follow along right here for live updates and analysis.
