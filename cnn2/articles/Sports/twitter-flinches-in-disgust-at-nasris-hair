Manchester City stayed on track to qualify for next season's UEFA Champions League with a narrow 2-1 win at home to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.
Manuel Pellegrini's side went into the game as firm favourites, but the Baggies took an early lead when¬†Stephane Sessegnon fired inside Joe Hart's near post:

GOALLLL!!!! Sessegnon scores for West Brom! Etihad stunned to silence (it has nothing to do with the poor attendance) #MCIWBA
